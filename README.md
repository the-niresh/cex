# cex

A centralised exchange in Rust. Spot markets first, perpetual futures on the same engine.

The exchange is a **deterministic state machine**: one function, `apply(state, command) -> events`,
running single-threaded over a durable command log. Everything else — HTTP, WebSocket, Postgres,
snapshots — is plumbing around that.

## Status

| Component | State |
|---|---|
| `cex-core` — matching, ledger, settlement | Built. 106 tests. |
| `cex-proto` — wire types | Built. |
| `engine` — stream consumer, snapshots | Not started |
| `api` — REST + auth | Not started |
| `ws` — market data fan-out | Not started |
| `persist` — Postgres writer | Not started |
| Perpetuals | Not started |

There is no runnable service yet. `cargo test` is currently the only way to exercise it.

## Getting started

```bash
docker compose up -d      # redis on 6390, postgres on 5442
cargo test                # 106 tests
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`; rustup will fetch the right compiler
automatically.

## Layout

```
crates/
├── proto/     # every message that crosses a process boundary
├── core/      # the engine. no tokio, no redis, no clock, no f64
├── engine/    # [bin] command stream in → core → event stream out
├── api/       # [bin] REST + auth
├── ws/        # [bin] market data fan-out
└── persist/   # [bin] event stream → Postgres
```

`core` has no async dependencies **on purpose**. A crate that cannot perform I/O cannot
accidentally become non-deterministic, and the constraint is enforced by the manifest rather
than by review.

## Design rules

These are not preferences. Breaking any one of them breaks something that depends on it.

**1. The engine is pure.** No clock, no randomness, no sockets, no file reads inside `apply`.
Anything from the outside world — timestamps, mark prices, funding ticks — enters as a command
appended to the log first. This is what makes snapshot-and-replay recovery exact. Break it and
replay silently produces different state than the original run.

**2. Money is integers.** `i64` counts of atomic units, `i128` for intermediate products, one
`mul_div` helper with explicit rounding direction. `f64` must never appear in `core`.

**3. Reads are not logged.** State-changing requests are `Command` and go on the durable stream.
Read-only requests are `Query` and travel on a separate channel. Logging reads would bloat the
log and slow every replay for no benefit.

**4. Locked balances are real.** Funds backing a resting order move from `available` to `locked`
and are released exactly, never recomputed. `check_invariants()` asserts after every command that
supply is conserved and that every locked atom is backed by a live order.

**5. Fills print at the maker's price.** Price improvement belongs to the taker, and any
difference between the reservation and the actual cost is refunded immediately.

## Naming conventions

Spot and perpetuals share this repository, this engine, and this order book. The conventions
below keep them distinguishable without duplicating anything.

### Market symbols

| Kind | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Spot | `BASE_QUOTE` | `BTC_USDT` |
| Perpetual | `BASE_QUOTE_PERP` | `BTC_USDT_PERP` |

A `Market` carries a `kind` discriminator; the suffix is a human convenience, never the thing
the code branches on. Never parse a symbol string to decide behaviour — look up the market.

### Crates

Package names are prefixed `cex-`; directories are not. `crates/core` is the package `cex-core`.
Binary crates keep their bare directory name as the executable (`engine`, `api`, `ws`, `persist`),
because that is what gets typed on a server.

### Modules in `core`

```
math.rs       shared    fixed-point arithmetic
market.rs     shared    market definitions, tick/lot rules
book.rs       shared    the order book. identical for spot and perps
balances.rs   shared    the asset ledger
spot.rs       spot      spot settlement
positions.rs  perps     position ledger
perps.rs      perps     funding, liquidation, mark price
state.rs      shared    apply(), dispatching on market kind
```

Perpetuals are **additive**. They do not fork the order book, the matching loop, or the recovery
mechanism — they add command variants, an event or two, and a position ledger alongside the
balance ledger.

### Commands

Neutral verbs shared by both (`Deposit`, `Withdraw`, `PlaceOrder`, `CancelOrder`) stay unqualified.
Perpetual-only commands are named for what they do, not for the product: `SetMarkPrice`,
`SettleFunding`, `Liquidate`, `ClosePosition`.

## Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| maker | The resting order. Provided liquidity, pays the lower fee. |
| taker | The incoming order that removed liquidity. Pays the higher fee. |
| bps | Basis point. 1 bps = 0.01%. |
| notional | Value of a trade in the quote asset: `price × qty`. |
| tick size | Smallest permitted price increment. |
| lot size | Smallest permitted quantity increment. |
| atom | The smallest indivisible unit of an asset. All money is counted in these. |
| base / quote | In `BTC_USDT`, BTC is the base (what you buy), USDT the quote (what you pay with). |
